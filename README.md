# Chat2023
This is the program developed for CPTR 328 that demonstrates a... well, not so simple chat program. It has the following features:

1. TCP Socket Application
2. Extension methods to write strings back and forth instead of just a stream.
3. Extension methods to write JSON on top of the strings.
4. The ability to Validate JSON against a Schema
5. A WPF (sorry - Windows only) client application that demonstrates Model View View Model (MVVM)

Enjoy! I'll try to add more documentation to it as we go.
